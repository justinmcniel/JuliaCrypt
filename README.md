Recreation of an old project I started making in highschool

It's an application for enthusiasts to encrypt data, then hide it in images with steganography.

It uses/will use Avalonia for the UI, OpenCL for image generation, JSON for saved settings, and C# libraries for encryption, with alternative options for manually implemented encryption algorithms
