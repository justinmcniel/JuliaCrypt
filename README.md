Recreation of an old project I started making in highschool
It's an application for enthusiasts to encrypt data, then hide it in images with steganography.
It uses/will use: 
  Avalonia for the UI
  OpenCL for image generation
  C# libraries for encryption, with alternative options for manually implemented encryption algorithms
